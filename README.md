# Personal Site

## Description:

This is the repo for my own personal portfolio website. The site gives a brief insight into what I do now as a software engineer as well as some glimpses into what I used to do as a violinist and some projects I've worked on as hobbyist sound designer.

## Known Issues
- SVG play button not displaying for audio players when viewing page in Firefox 
  - require import used for source which at least now renders the tag (alt text shown instead of image)
